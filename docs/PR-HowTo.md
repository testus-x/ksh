# Pull Request (PR) management

## Clone the repo
Before you start working on a fix or feature, you should clone the [ksh](https://github.com/ksh-community/ksh repository). You can do that by cloning the repository directly. However, to be able to submit PRs you need to have your own **ksh** clone on github.com. Clicking the **Fork** button on the upper right accomplishes this. Once you have done it, you get redirected to your ksh clone, which we call here **origin**. Once you have commited any changes to this repository, you can use the **New pull request** button to create new Pull request.
